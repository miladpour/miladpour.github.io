I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Vladimir Dvorkin](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dvorkin/). 

My primary research interests lie in Generative Models, Trustworthy Machine Learning (ML), and Information Theory. More specifically, my research focuses on AI/ML-driven decision-making, uncertainty quantification, data privacy, statistical inference, and related topics that connect foundational theory with the practical challenges of modern power and energy systems. To this end, I draw on ideas from diffusion models, differential privacy, conformal prediction, and sequential tests.

Feel free to email me if you come across any research interests we may have in common. I am always open to potential collaborations.
