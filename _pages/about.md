I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Vladimir Dvorkin](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dvorkin/). 

My primary research interests lie in Generative Models, Trustworthy Machine Learning, and Information Theory. More specifically, I work on diffusion models, uncertainty quantification, differential privacy, sequential inference, and related topics that connect foundational theory with the practical challenges of modern power and energy systems.

Feel free to email me if you come across any research interests we may have in common. I am always open to potential collaborations.
